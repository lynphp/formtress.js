## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [maintainers@yourdomain.com].

## What Should I Know Before Getting Started?

### Project Philosophy

Formtress.js is built on these core principles:

1. **Security First**: Every feature must be implemented with security as the primary concern
2. **Unobtrusive**: The library should work seamlessly without requiring significant changes to existing code
3. **Performance**: Security features should not significantly impact form performance
4. **Accessibility**: All features must maintain or enhance accessibility
5. **Reliability**: Code must be thoroughly tested and reliable

### Technology Stack

- Pure JavaScript (ES6+)
- No external dependencies
- Jest for testing
- ESLint for code quality
- WebdriverIO for E2E testing

## Security First Development

When contributing to Formtress.js, always keep security at the forefront:

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Input validation is strict and comprehensive
- [ ] Output is properly escaped
- [ ] No eval() or new Function() usage
- [ ] No DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] No prototype pollution possibilities
- [ ] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Rate limiting considerations
- [ ] CSRF protection intact
- [ ] Safe DOM manipulation

## How Can I Contribute?
